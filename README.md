My solutions for the Angular Fundamentals project so far.

I wrote **a lot** of comments in the javascript so I hope it will be useful.

# Angular Event Registration â€” Demo Application for Angular JS




This project is a sample application demonstrating a more fully developed realistic single page
angular application.


### Server

Two Servers are provided, an ASP.NET MVC server, and a node server. If using the ASP.NET server, simply start it up in IIS. If using the node server, from the command line run "npm install" and then either "server.sh" if you are on a linux box or "server.bat" if you are on a windows box.

### Running the application

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the app running in your browser. You may have to add the page to the url such as EventDetails.html depending on where you are at in the course. The port may be configured either in the node server or on IIS.
